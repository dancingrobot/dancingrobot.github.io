        <h4>Create and use a smile detector to send information to the arduino in order to send specified set of commands to the servo to execute a dance.</h4>

        <h3>Final Iteration</h3>
        <p>In this iteration, the MDF platforms supporting the servos are now round instead of square, and have holes cut through them to allow the servo cables to pass through to the arduino, which will be at ground-level. The Heave motion is supported with three aluminum rods that pass through nylon spacers in the upper platform, creating fewer moving parts and fewer failure points. Additionally, the tubes are attached to the bottom plate in a way that does not interfere with the support plate. They run through additional nylon spacers to ensure the tubes are square with the platform and each other, and are kept from moving up and down by music wire inserted through a hole below the platform and another above the spacer.</p>

        <p>Next, the scotch yoke assembly is made out of laser-cut delrin, reducing the friction between the faces as the servo turns the wheel.</p>

        <p>The upper servo is mounted in an MDF support, and the lower platform is supported by an MDF sheet. This allows the bottom servo to only exert a torsional force, and not compensate for cross forces.</p>

        <p>The mechanism that causes the penguin's wings to flap is seen in Figure 1. A micro-servo drives an ornithopter linkage that causes the wings to flap. After iteration 2, we felt that we had adequate time and resources to compensate for the dropped degree of freedom by adding a flapping motion. This motion will give the robot a higher degree of character and interactivity, as well as more variety in its motions.</p>

    <div class="content row" id="arduino">
      <section class="col col-lg-12">
        <h2>Arduino</h2>
         <p>We have three degrees of freedom for the body (swaying, heaving, and pitching) and a fourth degree for the wings (heaving).  We tested out a library called VarSpeedServo which can control up to 8 servos simultaneously, which we ended up using instead of the standard Arduino Servo library.</p>

          <p>There are five different dances programmed. The first executes when the penguin does not detect faces.  It sways for seven counts then switches to heaving for three seconds before resetting to the swaying motion.  The second dance executes when the penguin detects faces but no smiles. The penguin moves side to side, switches to up and down movements, then switches back to the side to side motion. The third dance executes when the penguin detects a smile.  To give the impression that the penguin is dancing and bouncing, we timed the swaying and heaving servos such that the body moves upward as it reaches the farthest programmed reach.  As the body sways to the opposite side, it bobs down.</p>

          <p>The fourth dance executes when there are more than one face, but not all faces are smiling. The penguin swivels and flaps at the same time.The fifth dance executes when there are more than one face, and all faces are smiling. The penguin swivels, flaps, bobbles up and down, and goes side to side, all at the same time.</p>

          <h3>Integration between python(smile detection) and Arduino(motors for dance):</h3>

          <p>For integration between the smile detector and the motor for the dance moves, we used Pyserial to write numbers to the serial port of the Arduino from python, depending on what the facial recognition software detected from the streaming video. A '0' is written when no faces are detected, '1' is written when at least one face is detected, but no smiles are detected, '2' is written when at least one face is detected and at least one smile is detected, '3' is written when more faces are detected then smiles and there are more than 1 face, and '4' is written when there are more than 1 face and all faces contain smiles.</p>

          <p>These numbers on the serial port are read by the arduino, and the arduino activated a combination of servos to execute one of 3 dance moves for the robot.</p>

          <p>We chose to use the webcam camera instead of a detached camera because we have found that the arduino does not have enough capacity to process everything quickly enough for the smile detection to be useful.</p>
